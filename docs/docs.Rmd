### Setup

.pull-left[

- The setup chunk shows the packages needed for this demo.   

- R will install specified packages if needed (only required once after R is installed)  

- R will load specified packaged (required every time you start a new R session)  

- The first time you run this code, R will install these packages which will be slow.  

- **If you get warnings, that's okay.**  

- If you get **error messages**, I (or TA), can help you.

### Specifing a SLR or MLR model in R

- Model specified with `ols_regress` in the `olsrr` package OR with `lm` (base R command)
   - Model format is always the same
   
- Interpretation of R<sup>2</sup> in SLR

```{r houses slr model and output, results='hide'}
(houses_slr <- ols_regress(Price ~ Area, data = houses))
```

#### Abridged Output

```{r slr abridged output, echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("docs_files/images/houses_slr_output1.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("docs_files/images/houses_slr_output2.jpg")

```

---

### Lecture 18 In-class Exercises 

#### **Question 3 (L18) - Session ID: bua345s23**

The correlation between `Selling_Price` and `Living_Area` is 0.772 and the R<sup>2</sup> for the SLR model is 0.596.

What proportion of the variability in selling price is explained by living area?

#### Abridged Output

```{r slr abridged output2, echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("docs_files/images/houses_slr_output1.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("docs_files/images/houses_slr_output2.jpg")

```

---

### Lecture 18 In-class Exercises - Calculating Residuals (Observed Y - Estimated Y) - 

#### **Question 3 (L18) - Session ID: bua345s23**

What is the residual for the second house shown in the data below?

```{r houses mlr model and output}

houses_mlr <- ols_regress(Price ~ Area + Bathrooms + Age, data = houses) # specify model

houses <- houses |>
  mutate(Est_Selling_Price = lm(houses_mlr$model) |> predict(houses) |> round()) # add regression estimates

head(houses, 4) |> kable()

```

---

### Additional Questions about MLR (Not in PointSolutions)

- **Why is the natural log (LN) transformation of Y is sometimes needed?**

  - Recall in R the command to do this is `log`.  In excel it is `ln`

  - How do we back transform estimates from a model when LN(Y) is the response?

     -  Can be done in Excel or R using `exp` function

- How to interpret Multiple Linear Regression output

  - **What hypothesis is being tested in each line of output?**

  - **What do we conclude if the P-value (sometimes labeled `Sig`) is greater than 0.05?**
  
  - Note that in Backward Elimination we set a P-value cutoff of 0.1 (`prem = 0.1`), but we can later exclude variables when determining the final model. 
  

---

### Lectures 12 and 13 (HW 6)

**Categorical Regression - Parallel Lines Model**

- How is this model different from SLR and?

- How do we determine if there two or more separate intercepts?
  
- **NOTE** that slopes for ALL categories are the same in a parallel lines model.  

**HW 6 Remodeled Houses Model Equations:**
    
- Model for un-remodeled Houses:

  - `Price = 166419.209 + 118.14*Square_Feet`
    
- For Remodeled Houses combine baseline intercept with difference due to remodeling (`RemodeledYes`)
    
- Model for Remodeled Houses:    

  - `Price = 166419.209 + 118.14*Square_Feet + 90325.284`
  
  - `Price = (166419.209 + 90325.284) + 118.14*Square_Feet`
  
  - `Price = 256744.5 + 118.14*Square_Feet` 
  
---

### Lectures 12 and 13 (HW 6)

**Categorical Regression - Interaction Model**

- How is this model different from SL

  - How do we determine if there two or more separate intercepts?
  - How is this model different from Parallel Lines Model
  - How do we determine if there two or more different slopes?
    
**HW 6 Diamonds Model Equations:**
    
- Model for Colorless Diamonds:    

  - `Price = -4446.56 + 10476.13*Weight`
    
- Model for Faint Yellow Diamonds: 

  - `Price = -4446.56 + 10476.13*Weight + 3464.41 - 6670.53*Weight`
  - `Price = (-4446.56 + 3464.41) + (10476.13 - 6670.53)*Weight`
  - `Price = -982.15 + 3805.6*Weight`
                                   
**Quiz 2 Practice Questions 11 and 12**

- Will Review these in class if there is interest.
- Question(s) on Quiz 2 will be similar and test R usage skills as well as ability to read and interpret interaction model output.

### Lectures 14, 15, 16 (HW 8 - Part 1)

**Model Selection**

- Examining Data using Correlation and Scatterplot Matrices (See above)

- Definition of Multicollinearity and how to determine if two variables are multicollinear

- Definitions and **R commands** for the following methods

  - Backward Elimination
  - Forward Selection
  - Stepwise Selection
  - Best Subsets

- Interpreting Measures of Model Fit

  - Adjusted R<sup>2</sup>
  - AIC
  - Mallow's CP

- Interpreting Final Model

  - Same as for other MLR models
  - Remember to back transform estimate of LN transformation is used
  - Residual = Observed Y - Estimate of Y

---

### Lecture 18 (HW 8 - Part 2)

**Logistic Regression**

- Definition of Odds: Odds is the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.

  - Recall that Odds can be calculated from probability
  - Probability is denoted as ***P*** or ***P(Event)***, e.g. ***P(Late Payment)***

    - $Odds = \frac{P(Event)}{1-P(Event)} = \frac{P}{1-P}$

- Converting Odds to Probability

    - $P = \frac{Odds}{1+Odds}$

- LN Odds are used as link function in Logistic Regression

  - Logistic Regression is used when Y is binary, a categorical variable with two categories such as:

     - Yes or No
     - Passed or Failed
     - Survived or Not Survived (Titanic Example in Lecture 17)
     - Late Payment or Not (Exampes in Lecture 17, HW 8, and Practice Questions)
    
---
    
### More about Logistic Regression

- We specify the Logistic Regression Model in almost the same way as a MLR model EXCEPT we use **`glm`(generalized linear model)** instead of **`lm` (linear model)**.
 
  - **GLM** relaxes the **LM** assumption that the response is quantitative and normal.
   
- The link function required for logistic regression is LN Odds (Log Odds)

  - **Estimated Response, Y', is the LN Odds of an Event**
  - **Convert LN Odds, Y' to Probability as:** $P = \frac{e^{Y'}}{1 + e{Y'}}$

     - Recall that in R and Excel, $e^{x}$ is calculated as `exp(x)` e.g. $e^{3}$ is `exp(3)` in R or `=exp(3)` in Excel.
     
     - Estimated LN Odds from Logistic Regression are converted to probability for interpretation (see below)
    
```{r log odds to probability example , results='hold'}

log_odds <- -1.4067                   # answer from HW 8 - Part 1 - Question 5
exp(log_odds)/(1 + exp(log_odds))     # calculation in R using exp function
plogis(log_odds)                      # calculation in R using plogis function
plogis(-1.4067)                       # calculation in R using plogis function and number

```
